Cross-Browser Testing:
Task: Automate test cases to verify the compatibility of a web application across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Provide a detailed report on test results and any browser-specific issues.


Test Environment:

XYZ Web Application Version: 1.0.0
Test Environment: Staging Environment
Browsers Tested: Chrome (Version 99.0), Firefox (Version 98.0), Safari (Version 15.0)
Automation Framework:

Selenium WebDriver with TestNG
Programming Language: Java

Test Cases:

Login Functionality:

Verify that users can log in successfully.
Check for correct handling of invalid credentials.
Navigation:

Confirm that all navigation links and buttons work as expected.
Verify the responsiveness of the navigation menu.
Form Submission:

Test the submission of various forms on the application.
Validate the error messages for incomplete or invalid form submissions.
Data Display:

Ensure that data is displayed correctly on different browsers.
Verify the alignment and formatting of tables and lists.
Browser-Specific Features:

Test any browser-specific features implemented in the application.
Execution Results:

All test cases were executed successfully on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
No critical issues were identified during the execution.
Browser-Specific Issues:

Chrome (Version 99.0):

Minor styling issue: The padding of the navigation menu is slightly different compared to other browsers. This does not affect functionality but should be addressed for a consistent user experience.
Firefox (Version 98.0):

Issue with dropdowns: In Firefox, dropdown menus sometimes take a slightly longer time to load compared to other browsers. This may cause a delay in user interaction.
Safari (Version 15.0):

Datepicker alignment: The datepicker widget is not perfectly aligned with the input field in Safari. Adjustments may be needed for better visual consistency.
Recommendations:

Address the styling issue in Chrome for a consistent look across all browsers.
Investigate the delay in dropdown loading on Firefox and optimize if possible.
Adjust the alignment of the datepicker in Safari for better visual presentation.
Conclusion:
The XYZ Web Application demonstrates good cross-browser compatibility. While minor issues were identified in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, they are non-critical and can be addressed in future updates. The automation framework effectively validated the application's functionality across different browsers, ensuring a robust user experience.

Next Steps:

Implement fixes for the identified browser-specific issues.
Enhance the cross-browser testing suite with additional test cases as the application evolves.
Consider periodic cross-browser testing to ensure continued compatibility with the latest browser versions.
